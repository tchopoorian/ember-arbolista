## Function API

* createHandler & deleteHandler

  Allow user to circumvent built-in create and delete. Simply pass them the node. Should this be the default?

* modelAttributes

  A function that sends attributes to the node model object for create and edit. User handles input and validation here.

* memberAdd() and memberDelete()

  Add members / children / items to each node via drag and drop.

* Component lifeccyle hooks?
